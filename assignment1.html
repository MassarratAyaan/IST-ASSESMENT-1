	<img class="imgr" src="img/ip2.png">
	<h2>TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP</h2>
	<p class="padding">
		IP is what the internet uses to move traffic from one network to another, which works with another protocol called TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which makes reliable end-to-end delivery of messages.
	</p>
	<img class="img" src="img/ftp.png">
	<p class="padding">
		HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol which requests and returns web recources. This is fast but unreliable, as it does not check if the resources have been successfully delivered. 
	</p>
	<p class="padding">
		(FTP) File Transfer Protocol is a protcol which transfers files from one platform to another. This is slower than HTTP, but is reliable, as it resends the files if they arent sent.
